      <div class = "note1">
    <p> The CSS3 Transform property lets you translate, rotate, scale and/or skew any element<br>
        on the webpage. We can manuipulate an element's appearance using transform functions. <br>

        Example: 
        <h2>Transform: Rotate(20 degrees):</h2>
        <div class ="a">Hello World!</div><br>

        <h2>Transform: SkewY(20 degrees):</h2>
        <div class="b">Hello World!</div><br>

        <h2>Transform: scaleY(1.5):</h2>
        <div class="c">Hello World!</div>

        
    
    </p>
      </div>
      <br> <br>
      <div class = "note2">
    <h3>Translate Functions</h3>


<p>
    Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down.<br>
    These functions are simliar to position: relative; <br>
    When you employ a transition function, you're moving elements without impacting the flow of the document.<br>
    Unlike the postition: relative function, which allows you to posisition an element either against its current position <br>
    or against a parent or other ancestor, a translated element can only be moved relative to its current position.<br>
    transform: translate(45px, -45px); <br>
    Examples:<br>
    <div class ="d">
    This div element is moved 50 pixels to the right, and 100 pixels  down<br>
    from its current position.</div>

    <div class = "e"> This div element is moved 45 px to the right <br>
    along the x axis.</div>
<br>
    <div class ="f">This div element is moved 30 px along the y axis.</div>

   
</p>
      </div>
      
      
      <div class = "note3">

<h5>Transitions</h5>
<p>
    Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time, essentially providing simple<br>
    animations. For example, if a link changes color on hover, you can have it gradually fade from one color<br>
    to the other transition can be gradual. If the browser lacks support for transitions, the change<br>
    will be immediate instead of gradual, which is fine accessible.<br>

   The steps to create a simple transition using CSS are as follows:<br>
   1. Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration.<br>
   2. Declare the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition<br>
   properties including: transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function,<br>
   and transition-delay.<br>
    Example:
    Hover over the div element below, to see the transition effect:<br>
    <div class ="g"></div><br>

    The transition-timing-function property:<br>
    Hover over the div elements below, to see the different speed curves.<br>

    <div id="div6"></div>
    <div id="div1">liner</div><br>
    <div id="div2">ease</div><br>
    <div id="div3">ease-in</div><br>
    <div id="div4">ease-out</div><br>
    <div id="div5">ease-in-out</div><br>

</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Notes from Chapter 12: Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h2>
      <p>
      With HTML5's Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine, all through JavaScript.<br>
      This can improve the performance of our websites by avoiding the need to download images off <br>
      the network. With canvas, we can draw shapes and lines, arcs and text, gradients and patterns. In addition, canvas<br>
      gives us the power to manipulate pixels in images and even video.<br>
      The HTML canvas element is used to draw graphics on a web page.<br>
      Example:<br>
      <canvas id="myCanvas" class="myCanvas" width="200" height ="200">
          Sorry! Your browser doesn't support Canvas!
      </canvas>
