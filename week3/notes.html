<h1>Week 03 Notes</h1>
<h2>Reading from JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, Chapters 4, 5, & 6</h2> 



<p style="max-width:150px;">I understand the concept of objects within methods, but still 
    struggle with it from time to time. 

    Example: 
    let user = {
        name: "John"
        age: 30
    };
     user.sayHi = function() {
         alert("Hello!")
     };
     user.sayHi(); //Hello! 


</p>

<p style="max-width:150px;">
    What is this? (the keyword)
    This is a keyword whose value changes depeding on how a function gets called.
    There are six different ways this can take on new values:
    1. this in global context
    2. this in object construction
    3. this in an object method
    4. this in a simple function
    5. this in an arrow function
    6. this in an event listener


    example of this in object construction:
    function Human (age) {
        this.age = age;
    }
    let greg = new Human(22)
    let thomas = new Human(24)

    console.log(greg) //this.age 22
    console.log(thomas) //this.age 24
</p>



<p style="max-width:150px;">
how to create an object literal:
const spiderman = {}; OR
const spiderman = new Object();

How to create new object by defining properties and values:
var objectName = {property1 : value1, 
                  property2 : value2,
                  //...
                  propertyN : valueN}

var student = { name : "Katie Borne"
                grade : "Senior"
                age : 28
}
or another way is to use a constructor function:
function student(name, grade, age)
{
    this.name = name; 
    this.grade = grade;
    this.age = age;
}

//create an object called studenta:
studenta = new student("Lucy", "Pre-K", 3);
studentb = new student("Oliver", "Pre-K", 2);
</p>

<p style="max-width:150px;">
    In JavaScript objects' methods run "inside" that object. 
    A method is a function associated with an object. They keys of objects are called properties
    which are containers for primitive values and other objects. 
    In case, when properties contain functions as their values, they are calledmethods. 
    Methods are defined the way normal functions are defined, except
    that they have to be assigned as the property of an object. 
Example:
    var myObj = {
        methodName: MyFunction(parameters)
        {
            statements
        }
    };
    myObj = name of an object  
    methodName = name of the method 
    Myfunction = name of the function
