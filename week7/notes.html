    <p>Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically<br>
       updates webpages without having to reload. This enables data to be sent and received in the background, as well as <br>
       portions of a page to be updated in response to user events, while the rest of the program continues to run.<br>

    <h3>Clients and Servers</h3>

<p>
    The internet is seperated into two parts: Clients and Servers. <br> 
    Clients requests a web page from a server, and the server processes and sends that request.<br>

    JavaScript was designed to be a client-side scripting language, meaning that it rans locally<br>
    in the browser (the client side/part), adding dynamic features to the web page that was returned from the server.<br>
    Ajax allows JavaScript to request resources from a server on behalf of the client. <br>
    It is usually requested using JSON data or html.<br>

    In order to use Ajax, a server-side language is required to do so. Languages such as:<br>
    PHP<br>
    Ruby<br>
    Node.js<br>
    .NET<br>

<h5>What is Cross-Origin Resource Sharing?</h5>
<p>
    Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server <br>
    to locate any other origins (domain, scheme, or port) than its own from which a browser should permit <br>
    loading of resources. CORS also relies on "preflight" requests used by browsers to see if the server<br>
    will host the cross-origin request. In that request, the browser sends headers that indicate <br>
    the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual request.<br> 
    
    <br>
    What requests use CORS? <br>
    Invocations of the XMLHttpRequest or API's<br>
    Web Fonts(for cross-domain font usage in @font-face within CSS)so that servers can deploy <br>
    TrueType fonts that can only be cross-site loaded and used by web sites that are permitted to do so.<br>
    WebGL Textures<br>
    CSS Shapes from images<br>

      <h3>The Fetch API</h3>
      <p>
       Fetch API is the current living standard for requesting and sending data asynchronously across a network.<br>
       It streamlines a number of concepts that had become cumbersome when using the XMLHttpRequest object.<br>

       How does it work?<br><br>
       The Fetch API proveides a global fetch() method that only has one mandartory argument, which is to<br>
       fetch the resource that was requested. Here's an example:<br><br>

       fetch('https://example.com/data')<br>
       .then(//code that handles the response)
       .catch(//code that runs if the server returns an error)<br><br>

       The fetch() returns a promise that resolves to the response from the URL that was provided as an argument. The .then handles<br>
       handles that response, and the .catch statement helps deal with any errors that may occur.<br>

      
      </p>
      
</div>    

<div class="note3">
    <p>
        <h3>The Reponse</h3>
        The Reponse interface deals with the object that's returned when the promise is fulfilled.<br>
        Example:<br><br>
        const url = 'https:example.com/data';

        fetch(url)
        .then((response) => {
            if(response.ok) {
                return response;
            }
            throw Error(reponse.statusText);
        })
        .then(response => // do something with response)
        .catch(error => console.log('There was an error!'))
  
  
        <h4>Headers Interface</h4>
        HTTP Headers are used to pass on any additional info about a request or response.<br>
        The Fetch API introduced a Headers interface, which can be used to create a headers object.<br>
        A Headers object has the following properties:<br>
        has(): Can be used to check if the headers object contains the header provided as an argument.<br><br>
                headers.has('Content-Type');<br>
                true; <br>
        get(): Returns the value of the header provided as an argument <br>
                headers.get('Content-Type');<br>
                'text/plain';<br>
        set(): Can be used to set a value of an already existing header, or create a new header<br>
        with the value provided as an argument if it does not already exist.<br><br>
                headers.set('Content-Type', 'application/json');<br>

        delete(): Removes the header provided as an argument.<br>
                headers.delete('Accept-Encoding');<br><br><br>
