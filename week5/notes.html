    <p>There are three types of Errors: <br><br>
        1. System error - usually caused by the system it is being operated on or a device 
        connected to it.<br>
        2. Prorammer error - usually a syntax error or logic that is faulty. <br>
        3. User error - the user has entered incorrect data that the program is not built to 
        process or understand.<br><br>
        
        Exceptions:<br>
        The point of an exception is to produce a return value that lets the user or programmer know
        that whatever it is that they are trying to "call" or activate does not exist within 
        the program. <br><br>
        
        Mythical unicorn function exception example:
        unicorn();<br>
        //ReferenceError: unicorn is not defined 
        
    
    </p>
      </div>
      <br> <br>

    <h3>Testing and Debugging</h3>

<p>
    Strict Mode produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of 
    some outdated features, but sometimes considers 'poor styles' as errors. 
    Strict mode encourages a better quality of JavaScript.
    ***Strict mode requires the following string to be added to the first line of a JavaScript file:
    'use strict';
    You can also use it in a function by function basis:
    1. Function basis: 
    function strictly(){
        'use strict';
        //function goes here
    }

    
</p>
      </div>
      
      
      <div class = "note3">
<p> 
    Linting tools are another great tool to test the quality of your JavaScript code beyond using just
    strict mode. They highlight sloppy programming practices and syntax errors. 
</p>
<h5>Alerts</h5>
<p>
    The alert method shows a dialog box to let the user know that they cannot access whatever portion of the code,
    or that their input is incorrect. <br>
    Example:
    
    function amIOldEnough(age){ <br>
    if(age = 12)<br>
      alert(age);<br>
      return 'No, Sorry.';<br>
   } else if(age > 18) {<br>
      return 'Only if you are accompanied by an adult.';<br>
 
  } <br>
    else { <br>
      return 'Yep, come on in!';<br>
  } <br>
  
  }<br>
  <br><br>

</p>
      </div>
      <p>
      <div class ="note2">
     
      <h3> Throwing Exceptions</h3>
      <p>
        Throwing exceptions is down by the programmer and embedded within the code. <br>
        Example: <br>
       function squareRoot(number) <br>
        'use strict'<br>
         if(number < 0){ <br>
            throw new RangeError('You can't find the square root of a negative number ); <br>
            } <br>
         return Math.sqrt(number); <br>
        }; <br>
        
      <br> <br>
      <h3>try, catch, and finally</h3>
      
      </p>
