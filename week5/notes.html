    <p>There are three types of Errors: 
        1. System error - usually caused by the system it is being operated on or a device 
        connected to it.
        2. Prorammer error - usually a syntax error or logic that is faulty. 
        3. User error - the user has entered incorrect data that the program is not built to 
        process or understand.
        
        Exceptions:
        The point of an exception is to produce a return value that lets the user or programmer know
        that whatever it is that they are trying to "call" or activate does not exist within 
        the program. 
        
        Mythical unicorn function exception example:
        unicorn();
        //ReferenceError: unicorn is not defined 
        
    
    </p>
    <h3>Testing and Debugging</h3>

<p>
    Strict Mode produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of 
    some outdated features, but sometimes considers 'poor styles' as errors. 
    Strict mode encourages a better quality of JavaScript.
    ***Strict mode requires the following string to be added to the first line of a JavaScript file:
    'use strict';
    You can also use it in a function by function basis:
    1. Function basis: 
    function strictly(){
        'use strict';
        //function goes here
    }

    
</p>
<p> 
    Linting tools are another great tool to test the quality of your JavaScript code beyond using just
    strict mode. They highlight sloppy programming practices and syntax errors.
