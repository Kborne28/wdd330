    <p> In a browser environment, the global object is the window object, which represents the browser window<br>
        that contains a web page. There are several aspects to a browsers environment. <br>
        The Browser Object Model (BOM)<br>
        Finding browser information <br>
        Browser History <br>
        Controlling windows <br>
        Cookies <br>
        Timing functions <br>

        <br>
        The Browser Object Model <br>
        <br>
        The BOM is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and the computer screen. <br>
        For example, we can find out which browser is being used to view a page. We can also find out the dimensions of the screen <br>
        it is viewed on, and which pages have been visited before the current page. It can also be used for the rather dubious practice of creating <br>
        pop-up windows if you want to annoy your users. All the properties and methods within the BOM are made available <br>
        by the window object. Every browser window, tab, popup, frame and iframe has a window object.<br>
        <br>
        How to find out what browser is being used using the window object: <br>
        window.navigaor.userAgent 
        
        <br><br>

        How to find out location of the URL of the current page: <br>
        window.location.href  
        <br>
        Some other location properties:<br>
        window.location.protocol : returns a string describing the protocol used (such as http, https, pop2, ftp )<br>
        <br>
        window.location.host : returns a string describing the web domain <br>
        <br>
        window.location.port : returns a string describing the port number.<br>
        <br>
        window.location.pathname : returns a string of the path that follows the domain.<br>
        <br>
        window.location.search : returns a string that starts with a '?' followed by a query string parameters. <br>
        <br>

    <h3>Location Object Method Examples</h3>


<p>
    
   
</p>
     
      <p>
          The Assign() method: This assigns the page to a new page<br>
          <button onclick="assign()">Load New Document</button>
      
      <br><br>

        The Reload() Method: This reloads the page <br>
        <button onclick="reload()">Reload Page</button>
      
      <br><br>
      
        The Replace() Method: This replaces the current page, similar to the assign method<br>
        <button onclick="replace()">Replace Page</button>
        
      
        </p>

<h5>Location Object Property Examples:</h5>
<p>
    Hash property Example: location.hash<br>
    Click the button to change the anchor part of the URL to #hashexample<br>
    <button onclick="hashFunction()">Try it!</button>
<br><br>
    Location Host Property: location.host<br>
    <button onclick="hostFunction()" id="host">Try Me!</button>
    <br><br>
    Location href Property: location.href<br>
    <button onclick="linkProperty()" id="link">Try This one!</button>
    <br><br>
    Location Host name property: location.hostname<br>
    <button onclick="hostName()" id="hostname">How Bout This One!</button>
    <br><br>
    Location Origin Property: location.origin<br>
    <button onclick="originFunction()" id="origin">Ok, what about this one?</button>

    <br><br>
    Location port Property: location.port<br>
    <button onclick="portFunction()" id="port">Here's Another One!</button>

    <br><br>
    Location Protocol Property: location.protocol<br>
    <button onclick="protocolFunction()" id="protocol">This one's cool!</button>

  <h2>Cookies</h2>
  <p>
          What are cookies? Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user's computer. They were invented by Netscape<br>
          as a way of getting around HTTP being a stateless protocol. This means that a browser does not remember anything from one request to another.<br>
          So every time a user visits a page, nothing about any previous visits is remembered. Cookies can be used to sidestep this problem<br>
          by storing information that can then be retrieved between requests. A restriction of cookies is that they can only be read by a web page from the same <br>
          domain that set them. This is to stop sites from accessing information about users, such as other sites they have visited. Cookies are also limited<br>
          to storing up to 4KB of data, although 20 cookies are allowed per domain, which can add up to quite a bit.<br>
          <br>
          Cookies are also used to personalize data to enhance their browsing experience, storing the users preferences, keeping track of their choices, (such as shopping)<br>
          authentication (purchases made, credit card info, name and address) and tracking users.<br>
          <br>
           The following are creating/deleting cookie attributes using document objects:<br>
           <br>
           Creating a Cookie:<br>
           document.cookie = "name=Johnny Bravo"; 
           <br>
           Creating a cookie, adding an expiration date: <br>
           document.cookie ="username=Johnny Bravo; expires=Thu, 25 Dec 2021 12:00:00 CST";<br>
           Creating a cookie, telling the browser what path the cookie belongs to:<br>
           document.cookie="username=Johnny Bravo; expires =Thu, 25 Dec 2021 12:00:00 CST; <br>
           path=/"<br>
           Delete a cookie:<br>
           document.cookie="username=; expires Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 CST; path=/;"<br>
           Read a cookie:<br>
           document.cookie;<br>

    <h2>Timing Functions</h2>
    <p>
        The window object provides some useful methods for scheduling the execution of a function, and for repeatedly executing<br>
        functions at regular intervals.<br>
        Here are some examples of differing timing functions:<br><br>
        Timeout Method : window.setTimeout(): <br>
        Click on the button, and wait 3 seconds and the alert will appear.<br>
        You can click "Stop the Message" to prevent the alert from appearing.<br>
        <button onclick="myVar = setTimeout(timeoutFunction, 3000)">Try Me!</button>
        <button onclick="clearTimeout(myVar)">Stop the Message!</button>

        <br><br>
        Set Interval Method: windlow.setInterval(): <br>
        A script on the page starts this clock:<br>
<p id="demo"></p>
