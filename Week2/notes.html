    <h1>Week 02 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Notes from reading JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, Chapter 2, 3 & 4</h2>
    <p> I think it's interesting that chapter 2 opens up about how important commenting is, and I couldn't agree more. 
        When you look at well commented code, everything can make sense a whole lot quicker when there are comments. 
        I prefer to comment with the multi-line comment. 
        
        It's really bizzare to me that you don't have to insert a semicolin at the end of each line, that JavaScript uses
        ASI (Automatic Semicolin insertion) 

        If a data type is not a String, symbol, number, bool, undefined or null, it is considered an object. 

        An operator applies an operation to a value, which is known as the operand:
        example: typeof 'hello' = The operator is typeof, and the string 'hello' is the operand  
   
        A binary operator would require two operand because it is dealing with numbers.
        3 + 5
        The operator is the + symbol, and the numbers are the operands. 
        What is a variable? Variables are used in programming langues to refer to a value 
        stored in the memory using the variable.
         In Javascript, it uses const and let to declare variables. Const is used when the variablewill not be 
         reassigned to another value, meaning it won't change, it will remain constant. 
         let is used if the variable may be reassigned later throughout the program.
        Use the = operator to assign a value to the variable.
                Example: const name = 'Alexa'; //This won't be assigned to any other String
                Example: let score = 0; //This value will probably change during the program
        However, it's important to note, that if we assign a non-primitive data type, such as 
        an array or object within a function, declaring it with const doesn't make it constant. 
        If you reassign it, it will change. 
        Example 
                const name: = {value: 'Alexa'}; //an object  
                name value = 'Siri'; //changing the value of name
                >> Siri 
        
        Scope: Local & Global
        Local = inside the block.
        Global = outside the block
            Example: const a = 1;
            {const a = 3; a;}
            << 3
            Checking the value outside of the block:
            a; 
            << 1
            using const or let makes it a local variable. Not using those makes it a global variable.
            aka block Scope

       
        String properties and methods:
        properties are accessed using dot notation: 
        example: 
            const name = 'Alexa';
            << Alexa
            name.length;
            << 5
        string methods are accessed also by dot notation:
        methods are an action that a primitive data type or object can perform. 
        Example: 
            name.toUpperCase();
            << 'ALEXA'

            name.toLowerCase();
            << 'alexa'
             Use the charAt method to find where position a character is at:
             name.charAt(1);
             << 'l'

             indexOf('A');
             << 0
