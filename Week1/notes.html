    <h2>Notes from Examples of Doing Stuff With the Web</h2>
    <p>I was following the examples of implenting javaScript code into a 
        button. And I noticed the example was wrong. I followed the example word for word, from pages 18-21,
        step by step, but noticed that nothing was happening when I clicked the button. 
        It has been a while since I have coded in javaScript, but I knew something wasn't right. 
        The example has the javaScript function like this:
        function showCongratulations(theButtonClicked) {
            document.getElementById("result_display").innerHTML = Congratulations, you did it"

        }
        Then, has the button tag further down: 
        <button>Click Me</button>
        <section id="result_display"></section>
        The button still wasn't doing anything, so I knew that the function and button weren't communicating.
        I then realized that there was no way the showCongratulations function was actually
        communicating the button. The only communication it had was to the <section> tag, stating
            where the text was to be displayed, but no actual connection to the button itself. 
            The author used the text the ButtonClicked, but did not have that anywhere else in 
            the code, so therefore, it was essentially referencing something that did not actually exsist!
            I changed theButtonClicked to button (referencing the button tag), and bam! It worked!
